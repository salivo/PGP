# Physics Gravity Project
### Calculation and visualization of N-body problem
and more... 
## Features
- Basic physics interactions (velocity, acceleration, impulse...)
- Gravity Simulation
- Follow separate body
  
## TODO:
- [X] Make simple physics canculations
- [X] Visulizate body
- [X] Control world with mouse
- [X] Body finder
- [X] Show body parameters
- [ ] Add ability to change delta and canculation per second
- [ ] Add Pause
- [ ] Add gravity processing 

# Used Technologies
- [OpenGL](https://opengl.org/)
- [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
  
## About Project
This Project is in development, and it was planned as School project,
